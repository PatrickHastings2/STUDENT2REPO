## reflection on glows/grows from your demo
from feedback, something you will add to individual CPT project

Our demostration went great at N@TM , we met plenty on people who were interested in out project and we recived lots of feedback. Most of the feedback was positive, including lots of comments about the aesthetics of our projet.  Something we will add to our project based on feedback is improvments to our quiz because it doesnt always produce acurrate results.
