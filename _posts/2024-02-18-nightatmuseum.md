## reflection on glows/grows from your demo

From feedback, something you will add to individual CPT project

Our demonstration went great at N@TM, we met plenty of people who were interested in our project and we received lots of feedback. Most of the feedback was positive, including lots of comments about the aesthetics of our project. Something we will add to our project based on feedback is improvements to our quiz because it doesn't always produce accurate results.

## something you saw in CompSci that impressed

I liked Aidan Delgado's group project because they made a site called Collabora, which allows students at Del Norte to ask and answer questions about school subjects.

## something you saw outside of CompSci that you liked

I went to the ceramics room and saw my friend Miguel's project, who made a mug that had a gnome's face on it.
